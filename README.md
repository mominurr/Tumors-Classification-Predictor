# Tumor Classification Predictor

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a predictive model for classifying tumors into different types based on their characteristics. It aims to develop a robust machine learning model that can accurately classify tumors into categories such as "Malignant" and "Benign."

## Functions and Features

### Tumor_Classification_Predictor

The "Tumor_Classification_Predictor" function is a comprehensive utility for performing tumor classification. It takes multiple input parameters representing tumor characteristics and provides two key outputs: model accuracy and predicted tumor type.

### Function Workflow

The function performs the following steps in its workflow:

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning:**

   - Load the tumor classification dataset using the Pandas library.
   - Perform data cleaning to handle missing values, duplicates, or any other data quality issues.

2. **Data Visualization:**

   - Utilize Matplotlib and Seaborn to create data visualizations, including scatter plots and histograms. These visualizations help users understand the distribution of tumor characteristics.

3. **Model Training:**

   - Train a machine learning classifier on the cleaned dataset. The classifier's goal is to predict the tumor type (e.g., "Malignant" or "Benign") based on tumor characteristics.

4. **Making Predictions:**

   - Use the trained classifier to make predictions on new data. The input parameters for prediction are characteristics of the tumor.

5. **Model Evaluation:**

   - Evaluate the performance of the trained model using accuracy and other relevant metrics.
